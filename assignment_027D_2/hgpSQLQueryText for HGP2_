This assignment instructions assumes that you have and sql_tutorial directory in your root drive and that you have a HGP directory within the sql_tutorial directory. Within that HGP directory you have the lesson_1.py Python app;

Instructions:  First type clear from the terminal.  This will leave the Terminal empty

1.  Create a new directory in your HGP directory and name it HGP2
2.  Use the mv command to move your lesson_1.py to the newly created HGP2 directory
3.  Edit the lesson_1.py by; 
		changing the connection = create_connection("hgp") to connection = create_connection("HGP2")
4.  Using the terminal navigte to the HGP2 directory and run the lesson_2.py app by typing 
			python3 lesson_1.py  This will create a new Sqlite database file file in the directory named HGP2.
5. Check to make sure the HGP2 file was created by typing ls from the command line.
6. To access the sqlite> command line type sqlite3 from the terminal. This will enable you to 		      write SQl Queries.
7.  Enter the following queries;

sqlite> .open hgp2     (this open your database file)
sqlite> .database      (this command displays the path to your Database File)
main: /Users/eugenelemon/sql_tutorial/hgp2

sqlite> create table staff(id integer primary key autoincrement,name text not null,cell text not null,position text not null);

sqlite> .table  (this is to check to make sure the staff table was created)

sqlite> insert into staff(name,cell,position) values('Baba Lemon','510.205.0980','Senior Educator Educator');    (This inserts one record into the database staff table)

sqlite> select * from staff; (This checks to make sure a record was inserted)


sqlite> create table leader(id integer primary key autoincrement,name text not null,cell text not null,position text not null,staff_id integer not null,foreign key(staff_id) references staff(id));  (This will create a Leader table)

sqlite> .table   (this is to check to make sure the leader table was created)
leader

sqlite> insert into leader(name,cell,position,staff_id) values('Andrew Lubega','925.727.4611','leader',1);   (This inserts one record into the database leader table)

sqlite> select * from leader;  (This checks to make sure a record was inserted)

sqlite> create table member(id integer primary key autoincrement,name text not null,cell text not null,position text not null,staff_id integer not null,foreign key(staff_id) references staff(id));  (This will create a Member table with references to the Staff table)

sqlite> .table   (this is to check to make sure the member table was created)

sqlite> insert into member(name,cell,position,staff_id) values('Moussa Xxay','934.727.4611','member',1);   (This inserts one record into the database Member table)

sqlite> select * from member;  (This checks to make sure a record was inserted)

8.  Quit the SQL (This will close the sqlite3> command line)

9.  Take a screen shot of all the commands from when you entered the clear command
